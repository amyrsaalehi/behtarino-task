This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3008](http://localhost:3008) with your browser to see the result.

---

and to run the cypress e2e testing server:

```bash
npm run cypress
# or
yarn cypress
```

## Preferable Technology

I prefer to use `ISR` technology instead of `SSR` or `SSG` because it's as fast as `SSG` and dynamic like `SSR`.

## Deploy on Vercel

You can check out [Live Demo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).
